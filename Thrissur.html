    <p id="place-discription">
      It is Kerala's most famous and largest waterfall at over 80 ft high. The sight of the water crashing onto the ground leaves you with a sense of wonder at the sheer power and magnificence of nature. Located around 63 km from Thrissur district, it is a perennial picnic spot for people in the area and  beyond. Its surrounding greenery is perfect for walks and picnics with loved ones. Lying at the entrance to the Sholayar forest ranges, it is a part of the Chalakudy River which calls the Western Ghats its home.
      These waterfalls became famous for not just their view but the endemic species found in the surrounding dense forests. Researchers have found four endangered species of the Hornbill here, the only place they thrive in the entire Western Ghats. Ornithologists attach great significance to this location and bird watchers can come across many rare and vibrant species in these parts.

    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Kerala Kalamandalam</h4>
    <hr id="head-line">
  <p id="place-discription">Kerala Kalamandalam has, for decades, been regarded as the most prestigious Kathakali school in the entire world. This legendary school of art is located in Cheruthuruthy and was originally set up by the famous poet of Malayalam, Vallathol Narayana Menon. The story goes that he recognised a subtle decrease in the interest people had in Kathakali and other traditional art forms and thus started the venture. Today, the Kalamandalam is the foremost proponent of a variety of traditional performing art forms that include Mohiniyattam, Kutiyattam, Thullal and Nangiarkoothu. It is also an official deemed University for Art and Culture.
    Founded in 1930 along the banks of the Nila (Bharathapuzha) River in Thrissur District, its ambience has assisted and nurtured Keralaâ€™s traditional art forms for nearly a century.

      </h4>
      <hr id="head-line">
    <p id="place-discription">Over forty elephants are groomed at the Punnathoor Kotta ( kotta means fort). Many elephants are brought as ritual offering to the temple. You can spend a whole day with these huge mammals here.
      Watching the naughty baby elephants' playful antics is an entertaining experience. The place provides you an opportunity to watch how the sick elephants are medically treated in the traditional manner. One can also watch the training given to the elephants for various ritualistic performances.
      Remember you are in the land where people worship the elephant-faced god Lord Ganapathy. Groomimg elephants were considered a status symbol. With the decay of the joint family system, supporting elephants became a financial burden for many families. Gradually various temple managements took the charge of looking after these animals. Anyhow, even today elephants play a key role in Kerala's fairs and festivals
