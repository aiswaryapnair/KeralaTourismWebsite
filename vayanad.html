        Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary</h4>
      <hr id="head-line">
    <p id="place-discription">
        Established in 1973, the Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary is contiguous to the protected area network of Nagarhole and Bandipur of Karnataka on the north east and Mudumalai of Tamil Nadu on the southeast. Rich in bio-diversity, the sanctuary is an integral part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The management lays emphasis on scientific conservation with due consideration for the general lifestyle of the tribals and others who live in and around the forest region. The Sanctuary has a large population of pachyderms and has been declared a Project Elephant site.
    Elephants roam freely here and tigers are sighted occasionally as well. Various species of deer, monkeys and birds also live here. The Reserve is also home to a profusion of birds, butterflies and insects. The trees and plants in the sanctuary are typical of the south Indian moist deciduous forests and semi-evergreen forests.

    <h4 class="text-uppercase">BanasuraSagar Dam</h4>
    <hr id="head-line">
  <p id="place-discription">It is the largest earth dam in India and the second largest of its kind in Asia. The dam is made up of massive stacks of stones and boulders.
    Situated about 15 km from Kalpetta, the dam holds a large expanse of water and its picturesque beauty is enhanced by the chain of mountains seen on the backdrop.  It is constructed in the Banasura Lake and the nearby mountains are known as Banasura Hills. Legends say that the Asura king of Banasura, (the son of King Mahabali, who is believed to visit Kerala during every Onam festival) undertook a severe penance on the top of these hills and thus it was named after him.  The scenic mountains beckon adventure tourists and the dam site is an ideal starting point for trekking.
    During monsoon, visitors may also be able to see small islands in the damâ€™s reservoir. They are formed while the flooded reservoir submerges the surrounding areas too. </p>

      </h4>
      <hr id="head-line">
