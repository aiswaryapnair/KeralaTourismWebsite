            Celebrated as the Granary of Kerala, Palakkad is a vast stretch of fertile plains interspersed with hills, rivers, mountain streams and forests. The gateway to Kerala from the north, a 40 kilometre break in the mountains known as the Palakkad Gap gives access to this land situated at the foot of the Western Ghats. The pass acts as a corridor between Kerala and the neighbouring Tamil Nadu and played a key role in the trade relations between the east and west coasts of peninsular India. Deriving its name from the Malayalam words Pala (Alsteriascholaris) and Kadu (forest), this place was once a stunning expanse of forest covered with the sweet-scented flowers of the Pala tree. A potpourri of Tamil and Kerala culture, some of the finest Carnatic musicians hail from this district which continues to be a principally agrarian society.

        Tipu's Fort, also known as Palakkad Fort, is a beautifully maintained edifice in Palakkad district and was an important military base in the past. Rebuilt by Hyder Ali in the 18th century, the fort was under the Mysore rulers until the British took control of the place. It was then used for providing government services during the British era. Named after Hyder's son Tipu Sultan, it is an important historical destination today.
        It is among the best preserved forts in South India. The thick laterite walls impress all who view it. People frequent the spot for relaxing walks and jogs. A large ground that lies between the Fort and the Palakkad town hall is an important location for public meetings and important functions. Today it is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. It is a preferred picnic spot for everyone visiting Palakkad.

    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Silent Valley National Park </h4>
    <hr id="head-line">
  <p id="place-discription">Located in the Northeast corner of Palakkad district, Silent Valley was named a National Park only in 1984. It was called 'Sairandhrivanam' as it was here that Sairandhiri (the secret identity donned by Panchali, from the epic Mahabharata) is believed to have hidden along with her five husbands, the Pandavas, while escaping their cruel cousins, the Kauravas. The Kunthippuzha River which feeds the entire forest was named after Kunthi, mother of the Pandavas. It is shielded by the Nilgiri Plateau to the North and the Mannarkkad Plains to the South. It constitutes the centrepiece of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, an integral part of the Western Ghats, christened a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2012.
    Many have passed through here since then but none have been able to put to words the exact feelings or detail the emotions evoked by the experience these forests have to offer.

      </h4>
      <hr id="head-line">
    <p id="place-discription">From the town of Nenmara in Palakkad district, the cloud-caressed peaks of the majestic Nelliyampathy Hill ranges are a sight to behold. The height of the hills ranges from 467 m to 1,572 m and it has an extremely calming effect on all who view it. To reach Nelliyampathy, one has to take the road starting from Nenmara that proceeds to the Pothundy Dam. There are about 10 hairpin bends that have to be negotiated on the way to Nelliyampathy.
        On the way up, those interested in bio farming can take a close look at the privately managed farms and also vast expanses of tea estates managed by different plantation companies. The hills of Nelliyampathy are also well known for their orange cultivation.
        The Pothundy Dam is a beautiful locale with facilities for boating and is a nice option as a picnic place.
